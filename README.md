# SyntheticHealth

Generate realistic synthetic healthcare data based on UK healthcare statistics and NHS data patterns for machine learning and research applications.

## Overview

SyntheticHealth is an open-source project that generates synthetic healthcare data modeled on UK healthcare patterns and statistics. It addresses the critical shortage of accessible healthcare datasets for machine learning research while maintaining the specific characteristics of UK healthcare data, including NHS coding standards and typical British population health patterns.

## ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ UK Healthcare Focus

This project specifically models:
- UK demographic distributions
- NHS coding standards and terminologies

## ðŸš¨ Important Notice

This project is currently in active development. While the generated data aims to reflect realistic UK healthcare patterns, it should NOT be used for:
- Clinical decision making
- Real patient care
- Production healthcare systems
- Medical research without proper validation

## âœ¨ Features

- Generate synthetic patient demographics based on UK population statistics
- Create realistic vital sign time series aligned with NHS normal ranges
- Simulate lab results using UK laboratory reference ranges
- Model disease progression patterns based on UK health outcomes data
- Generate comorbidity relationships reflecting British population health patterns
- Export data in NHS-compatible formats
- Support for UK-specific healthcare coding systems
